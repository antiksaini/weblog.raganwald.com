					<a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/02/hof-or-oop-yes.html" title="permanent link">HOF or OOP? Yes!</a></span>
					<div style="clear:both;"></div><br/><br/>It&#8217;s interesting how the brain works: I wrote an essay that I thought was <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/01/closures-and-higher-order-functions.html">an explanation of what first class functions and closures <em>are</em></a>, and why some people would like to see them added to the <a href="http://www.java.com">Kitchen Sink of Languages</a>.<br /><br />Then I read <a href="http://www.wuenschenswert.net/wunschdenken/archives/117">From Functional to Object-Oriented Programming</a>, which suggests that my essay seems to be making a general statement about Functional Programming as an advance over Object Oriented Programming.<sup>1</sup><br /><br />Nothing could be further from my intention or my opinion. Smalltalk, for example, has a clean and powerful syntax for first-class functions. And those first-class functions are objects, as is <em>everything</em> in Smalltalk. I am tempted to rewrite my essay using Smalltalk: it seems that using <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>, another language where everything is an object, is not making this point strongly enough. In my mind, it is easy to use languages that provide the OO paradigm as well as the first-class function paradigm. At the same time.<br /><br /><strong>What I actually said</strong><br /><br />So what I actually said is: &#8220;Here are these things called <em>first-class functions</em>. This &ldquo;thing&rdquo; is where functions are exactly the same kind of thing as everything else in a language. This is useful, here is why.&#8221; If functions are first class, functions aren&#8217;t magically more special, nor are they second-class citizens in a language (like those brain-damaged primitives in crippled languages). If a language is an OO language, this implies that first-class functions in such a language are objects and that programming with them <em>is</em> OO programming.<br /><br />You&#8217;ll notice that I am not using the words &#8220;Functional Programming.&#8221; That&#8217;s because <strong>I&#8217;m not talking about Functional Programming</strong>. I&#8217;m talking about closures and first-class functions. I imagine that these things are present in all contemporary Functional Programming Languages, but that has nothing to do with my essay about the value of having first-class functions in an OO language: Smalltalk has had them in an OO language <em>for nearly thirty years</em>, and while it wasn&rsquo;t the first OO language, it is the canonical definition of class-based OO.<br /><br />That&#8217;s all I said. If you want to debate the merits of pure functional programming languages like <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> against OO languages like Ruby, you have to take that up with someone like <a href="http://blog.moertel.com/" title="Tom Moertel">Tom</a> or <a href="http://www.randomhacks.net/" title="Eric Kidd">Eric</a>.<br /><br /><strong>What I don&#8217;t understand</strong><br /><br />I don&#8217;t understand the author&#8217;s objection to higher-order functional programming. He(?) says something about higher-order functions and type inference as being bad. I don&#8217;t get the argument. It seems like he is saying that the constructs are somehow too deeply nested, that it is too easy to make mistakes. I may not understand him correctly, for I have trouble seeing how this is different from having data structures with a thicket of HAS-A relationships.<br /><br />Somehow we program just fine in business with complex data schema, and we manage to keep track of things just fine. Strong typing and compiler support helps. So does IDE support. So does drawing diagrams. How is &#8220;a function taking an integer and a function taking two integers, returning a function taking a list of integers and returning an integer&#8221; somehow more complex than &#8220;a record containing an integer and that has many records containing an integer&#8221;?<br /><br />The argument seems to be (and I am open to correction, since what I think he&#8217;s saying is so obvious that I worry I&#8217;m misunderstanding it) that naming things makes all the difference, as in &#8220;a customer record with an ID has many Sales Records, each of which has an ID.&#8221; That does sound easier to understand.<br /><br />But of course, nothing stops you from naming things if you have first-class functions in a type checked OO language, does it? I am not a practitioner, but I have been working my way through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/026256114X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=raganwald001-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=026256114X">The Little MLer</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=raganwald001-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=026256114X" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, and it is part of the ML programming paradigm to name first-class functional types for precisely the reasons the author seems to advocate.<br /><br /><strong>Anonymity considered harmful?</strong><br /><br />So perhaps the objection is to having too many anonymous things, to having too many values without names. There is certainly an appropriate balance to be sought. One language designer seems to dislike anonymous functions, to the point where his language won&#8217;t let you have any that won&#8217;t fit on a single line. He has an <em>opinionated</em> language.<br /><br />I have seen similar arguments with non-functions. That control flow branches should not be nested too deeply (you know, <code>case</code> and <code>if</code> and the evil ternary operator). I often use the &#8220;extract variable&#8221; refactoring to simplify expressions and make them more readable. Naming a part of an expression provides a certain level of abstraction that improves comprehension.<br /><br />Types and expressions involving functions are no different, and if that&#8217;s what the author is saying I endorse his perspective.<br /><br />That statement, however, is somewhat orthogonal to whether first-class functions should exist in a language. As long as you can name them, you have the tool to write comprehensible code. If your language has types, then you ought to be able to name types involving first-class functions. As long as you can name functional values and types, you can apply all the same style guidelines to first-class functions that you apply to record types.<br /><br /><strong>In Conclusion</strong><br /><br />First-class functions are a natural fit with OO, as evidenced by their presence in OO languages that aren&#8217;t glorified PDP-11 assemblers with some OO stuff bolted on the side by people with <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/blog/2007/01/23/the-sun-also-sets/">very little OO and/or GUI programming experience</a>. First-class functions can be used to write clean and legible code, using all of the same techniques we use for writing clean and legible code with records, objects, and other types.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.wuenschenswert.net/wunschdenken/archives/117">From Functional to Object-Oriented Programming</a> has some interesting points about FP and OOP and their historical context. This has nothing to do with my original post, but I think those words are worth reading and considering. The post raises some caveats about complex and anonymous first-class functions that are obviously sensible: we have noticed the same things with other forms of expression in programming.<br /><br /><hr/><br /><ol><li>I will come clean here: when I think of OO, I am <em>not</em> thinking of C++ or Java, especially as they are practised in business. I&#8217;m thinking of languages like <a href="http://research.sun.com/self/language.html">Self</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor">Actor</a>, and <a href="http://www.smalltalk.org/">Smalltalk</a>.</li></ol><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/labels/lispy.html">lispy</a></p>&nbsp;

								<a name="117043162597465163"></a> 				Well, you're welcome to debate the relative merits of functional programming and Ruby with me, but I'll argue both sides. :-)<BR/><BR/>More seriously, there are some cases where OO is the <I>right answer</I>, and where functional programming by itself will make your code nasty.<BR/><BR/>Exhibit A: On our last big Scheme project, we had a number of programmers write GUI components using either an OO style or a functional style. The components written in an OO style were nicely reusable, but the ones written in a classical Scheme style generally turned into unextensible balls of hair.<BR/><BR/>At the moment, I'm rewriting our low-level OO framework for Scheme to encourage a more Rubyish style on our next project.<BR/><BR/>Now, I'll happily agree that OO is much nicer with decent support for functional programming. But this is one of those peanut butter/chocolate things: You're better off having both, if at all possible.<BR/><BR/>Or to look at it from the other direction, there are some designs which can be expressed elegantly in O'Haskell that would be downright ugly in regular Haskell.<br />

								<a name="117043492209480582"></a> 				I think people have a problem with first-class functions because they are so wierd compared to the standard OO stuff.  OO has a direct parallel with real world stuff.  Functions in general don't have a concrete parallel.  If you have studied a lot of math, they are probably easier.  If you don't get first-class functions, you won't get closures.  <BR/><BR/>I remember reading about both of them for the first time about a year ago.  It took me a while to get what they were about, and how they were different than other constructs.  Once I got it, I realized that I had been using both for years programming javascript.<BR/><BR/>As a corralary, I think that's why some people have trouble with JS: to use it efficiently, you need FCFs and Closures.<BR/><BR/>About a month into my current job, I had a code review, and the reveiwers seemed totally baffled by something like "var foo = function(bar) {...}".<br />

The closing over part isn't handled well by the current behaviour of anonymous inner classes.<BR/><BR/>That being said, the original post talked about the need for a cleaner syntax. I'm very happy with the idea that first-class functions in Java could be syntactic sugar for anonymous inner classes plus some extensions so you can capture local variables and parameters.<BR/><BR/>This would be parallel to <B>enum</B>, which is really syntactic sugar for the old "Type Safe Enumeration" pattern.<br />

I think OO as practiced in the industry is way too complex. I find Java and C++ to be quite intellectually challenging, whereas I can understand Lisp and F# just fine.<br />

I remember my Java classes at University fo Wisconsin being boringly easy -- granted I did take a year of C++ in High School.  When you ask someone to move out of their comfort zone, and learn a new language and paradigm, some people get scared.  I think this is especially true for a language like Java which tries to abstract the wrong things.<br />

Since no code can modify the data in place (it's all effectively "const"), it's safe to overlap different versions in this way.<BR/><BR/>For a really excellent book on this subject, see <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/Purely-Functional-Structures-Chris-Okasaki/dp/0521663504" REL="nofollow">Purely Functional Data Structures</A>. <BR/><BR/>So in an object oriented language, you use lists of commands to implement undo, but in a functional language, you use plain old data!<br />

								<a name="117045432252217954"></a> 				The real problem with higher order function is that it encourages, and sometimes enforces creating anonymous objects, which is generally bad. You should always name your types, your objects and yes, your methods too. Any anonymous object, of any kind constitutes a possible threat to code maintenance unless you have foresight and KNOW that this never needs to be named. (The only possible exception are numbers, because infix calculations are so readable and commonly understood that it's needless to name intermediate result.)<BR/><BR/>That's why I not only reject HOF, but anonymous classes and unnamed objects as well.<br />

								<a name="117047097821862306"></a> 				Yeah, how you name things and HOF are othorgonal. Python vs. Perl shows that pretty well; both can do it, Perl is much friendlier if you don't like naming things.<BR/><BR/>I find I've come to appreciate the Python way of doing things when it comes to working with the code of others. It's extremely rare for me to encounter even a snippet of code that I really can't put a name on, and that often constitutes a code smell anyhow. (In the original sense of "code smell"; it isn't <I>a priori</I> a problem, but it probably indicates you're still fuzzy on exactly what's going on, which happens.)<BR/><BR/>If you're writing code on your own, go to town. But I really like naming things, even when I'm in pure functional. I really like the ability to "read" off programming statements, even if the grammar is in a different order than English.<br />

That's why I prefer to rely on languages and tools to guarantee that programs I create (along with the team) have no unnamed objects, no unnamed classes. They do enforce the discipline and when this discipline is enforced, the names they give objects are meaningful too.<BR/><BR/>YAGNI is a good rule for avoiding overdesigns, we do use it too, but it's not good for avoiding "overnaming" (if such a thing existed) because I name things not for this myself sitting at the keyboard NOW, but for that myself who will try and understand the code a year later, or even for other people trying. YAGNI is so good because by demanding to keep things simple makes it easy to add needed things later, when they are really needed. But there is no such thing as "easily naming objects later": it will just always be very hard. That's why you should name things as you write, and not leave it for ever.<BR/><BR/>(And, this makes static manifest typing an obvious thing you want to have in your language.)<br />

For example, if an "agile" shop sets up a continuous integration server that rejects any code that breaks the build, you have a form of bondage.<BR/><BR/>If an "agile" shop encourages "YAGNI" through training, code review, and refactoring to YAGNI, you have discipline.<BR/><BR/>So...<BR/><BR/>I would say that both really do have their place, and the important thing is to find the balance that works properly for your group and your project.<BR/><BR/>Pax!<br />
