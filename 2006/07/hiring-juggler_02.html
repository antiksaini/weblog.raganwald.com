								<a name="115195993130859490"></a> 				I don’t know about you, but before a candidate walks into my office for their first interview, I Google them.  <BR/><BR/>Resumes just aren’t enough to determine depth and breadth of experience.  It makes it much easier on me if a Google search produces a hit on a website or blog that contains coding samples and technical observations.  I personally also like to see stuff about the candidate.  It’s nice to know if they are involved in volunteer work and what their extracurricular activities are.  In an interview you can’t really directly ask about personal stuff, but a blog will usually contain those little pieces of information that can provide a bigger picture.<BR/><BR/>I personally like to work with well-rounded individuals who I know have initiative.  You can’t get that from a resume or even during the interview but from a blog...yes.  I wrote a <A HREF="http://krgreenlee.blogspot.com/2006/04/business-engineering-value-of-blogging.html" REL="nofollow">post</A> a few months ago where I state my belief that if you want to be an engineering contender, you need to blog about technical stuff. Or at least find some medium to share and help others.  Such as forums and articles, where your name is going to show up.<br />

								<a name="7739088580840967770"></a> 				I've been through many interviews lately, and I've come to few conclusions. I've been reading this and other blogs, and now I feel I'm ready to comment.<BR/><BR/>1. Big companies don't care about any of your experience. They interview fresh graduates and experienced developers all the same. Sorry guys, I'm pretty much tired of calculating the best floor to drop the egg off (and it's the same question in many companies). I hope that some time we can really talk about the projects I did.<BR/>2. Most companies ask design questions. That's ok, but the problem is that they ask questions about the problems they've encountered themselves and expect you to come up with the same answers as they did, taking into account the specific restrictions they had. I think this is wrong, because their solution might not be the best available and obviously you can't think of the restrictions they have in their project (their solution might be the best under the 100 restrictions they have but they don't tell you about it in the interview). It probably took them several weeks to come up with a good solution that accounts for all the possible problems. I'm sorry, I think I'm a good developer, but not a wizard, and I can't do it in 30minutes. Another example for such biased thinking is that in two interviews I was asked to implement a function that searches a string for one of possible characters given as other string (I don't remember its C name - I'm a more of a java programmer). At one company a simple solution that uses a 256 byte array was fine and was exactly what they expected. At another company they expected me to propose a solution that handles unicode characters as well (using a hash) and were not happy at all about the array solution.<BR/>3. In some companies I've received a written Java test. In a subset of them they had errors in their test. Were they kidding!?<BR/>4. Programming questions are nice and I like them. However I really hate writing programs on a piece of paper for two reasons. I'm used to write with a pen and I'm used to write code in several iterations. For example, I can start with checking for some preconditions, then in the middle of the algorithm think of a better idea and start changing the code I've already written. When using a computer (even notepad) there is no problem in doing that. Writing the code on paper makes a huge mess....<BR/><BR/>That's my 2cents and rants on interviews....<br />
