					<div style="clear:both;"></div>So I find myself sitting still for a technical interview with a faceless corporation that&#8217;s hiring contract programmers. Right away the answer to all my problems is &#8220;don&#8217;t do that!&#8221; But anyways, I did it, and here&#8217;s how it goes&#8230;<br /><br />I meet four junior-ish programmers that pepper me with Java and SQL questions. I get it all just about right, although I was unsure about one of the SQL questions. They seemed satisfied, but maybe they don&#8217;t bother to shake their fingers at hapless interviewees when they blow a question&#8230;<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/uploaded_images/buggy-729989.png"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://weblog.raganwald.com/uploaded_images/buggy-728535.png" border="0" alt="" /></a>When I get home I try it on my laptop and discover I&#8217;d left something out of my SQL answer. I get it right and like a good brown noser I send them an email thanking them and correcting my answer, being careful to explain that I&#8217;d tried it like a hands-on person rather than googling the answer like a student.<br /><br />This wins me a second interview, and once again I get technical questions, these ones a little better. The first set were all right and wrong answers, these ones include an opportunity to share your thinking, such as:<br /><br />&#8220;<em>What&#8217;s the difference between an Abstract Class and an Interface? Explain when you would use one versus the other</em>.&#8221;<br /><br />All goes well until I&#8217;m asked to explain the difference between static and instance methods, and give examples of how to call them. I do so, and write out a series of calls including this one:<br /><br /><pre><code>    someInstance.staticMethod();<br /></code></pre><br />I explain that <em>it&#8217;s allowed by the compiler but I never do that</em>. The lead tech guy shakes his head, saying no, it&#8217;s not allowed. Okay, I&#8217;m not perfect, I explain that I thought it was allowed but not a good idea, but I could be wrong. Either way, I&#8217;m not writing that code.<br /><br />They finish by asking me to write code for permuting strings. I include command line flags, help, <a href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit</a> tests, I go all out and take thirty minutes. He seems impatient for me to finish, even though inside sources told me they&#8217;ve hired people who took forty-five minutes to complete the code.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHow-Would-Move-Mount-Fuji%2Fdp%2FB000ESSSN4%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1165595626%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&tag=raganwald001-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://weblog.raganwald.com/uploaded_images/move_mt_fuji-703316.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>When it&#8217;s all over, he&#8217;s escorting me to the elevator. I ask him how it went. &#8220;Some good, some not so good.&#8221; He says. You can guess where this is going&#8230; He explained that I got the method code wrong, and that really was not so good.<br /><br />What can I do? Of course, when I get home, I check the answer. I&#8217;m deflated to discover that I was right. This doesn&#8217;t help, I&#8217;m not going to get a job by telling him he got it wrong. I&#8217;d rather be wrong and admit it.<br /><br />Of course, some people would shrug and say it&#8217;s a minor detail, they don&#8217;t mind getting it wrong. I&#8217;m one of those people. But if I&#8217;m interviewing, I don&#8217;t hold those details against people. This guy seems to think that knowing the details of the language are important. So I&#8217;m not going to tell him he would fail his own test.<br /><br />So all I can do is blow off a little steam on the web and look forward to interviewing elsewhere.<br /><br />Thanks for listening, I feel better now.<br /><br />(This originally appeared in the <a href="http://discuss.fogcreek.com/joelonsoftware/default.asp?cmd=show&amp;ixPost=151541">Joel on Software discussion group</a> shortly after the interview: time has <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2006/12/trick-or-bleep.html" title="Trick or Bleep?">mellowed my perspective</a> since then.)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Follow up</span>: In hindsight, this is good for a laugh. What are your thoughts about interviews like this? Should I have respectfully disagreed with the interviewer? Should I have deliberately left any anti-patterns out of my answer? Perhaps I missed an opportunity to turn the discussion towards one of my strengths?<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/labels/jobs.html">jobs</a></p>&nbsp;

								<a name="116559637109596707"></a> 				Greg, thanks. I've seen this tactic discussed at length, most recently after Joel Spolsky suggested it.<BR/><BR/>I have used a variation when interviewing, but I put things a little more neutrally, such as:<BR/><BR/><I>Greg, common practice in the industry is to include as many design patterns as possible in an application. What are your thoughts about Design Patterns?</I><BR/><BR/>After explaining that I thought this was legal, I'm not sure how far I should have taken it: after all, it is a well-known anti-pattern for various reasons (most especially in Java where static methods are not polymorphic, a hideous language flaw).<BR/><BR/>But if the interviewer was looking for moxie, perhaps I should have pressed the point politely.<br />

More like the side effect of a tool making you ignorant about the under currents.<BR/><BR/>Seems like it turned out good for you anyway.<br />

								<a name="116560400576075977"></a> 				One time I interviewed for a company that said they would be giving me an html test to make sure I have my stuff together.  Fine, I know html, and can make anything happen in half an hour.  When I get there, it becomes clear they are going to give me a standardized test.  Too bad I was already there.  By question three it becomes clear that a lot of the questions are riddled with nongrammatical, noncompiling questions and code.  By question eight it starts going into what you can and can't do with tables in IE3.  <BR/><BR/>Little did I know this company owns a time machine, and desperately need a developer for this big project in '97.<br />

								<a name="8055278351999458983"></a> 				Thank you for your post. Once I had an interview and the guy who was interviewing me kept asking me incorrect questions. I was well-prepared, so I knew who to answer. My advice, prepare well before your interview and trust your self. I run across www.technical-interview.com which helps with interview preparation.<br />

								<a name="3501221663938363173"></a> 				All for the best anyway.  If a company is all about giving pop-quiz like questions, they better be darned sure of the answers before telling you that you're wrong.<BR/><BR/>I'm also fond of using expressions like "I'm 98% sure X works this way."  When someone flat out states something that later turns out to be false, I start to doubt things that they say.  If he at least admits he's not 100% sure of something, then his credibility remains intact.<BR/><BR/>(let's not forget.. there is after all a world market for maybe 5 computers... =))<br />
