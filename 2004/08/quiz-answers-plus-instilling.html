					<div style="clear:both;"></div>In <a href="http://www.braithwaite-lee.com/weblog/2004/08/surprize-quiz.html">Surprise Quiz!</a>, I asked:
<br /><blockquote>You have just been promoted to head of an important department in your organization. The previous head has been transferred to an equivalent position in a less important department. Your understanding of the reason for the move is that the performance of the department as a whole has been mediocre. There have not been any glaring deficiencies, just a perception of the department as so-so rather than very good. Your charge is to shape up the department. Results are expected quickly. Rate the quality of the following strategies for succeeding at your new position.</blockquote><ol><li>Always delegate to the most junior person who can be trusted with the task.</li><li>Give your superiors frequent progress reports.</li><li>Announce a major reorganization of the department that includes getting rid of whomever you believe to be "dead wood."</li><li>Concentrate more on your people than on the tasks to be done.</li><li>Make people feel completely responsible for their work.</li></ol>
<br />In <a href="http://www.gladwell.com/2002/2002_07_22_a_talent.htm">The Talent Myth</a>, Malcolm Gladwell reported "how well people do on a test like this predicts how well they will do in the workplace: good managers pick (2) and (5); bad managers tend to pick (3)".
<br />
<br />What I find interesting about this snippet is the relationship between the answers and Agile values: Frequent reporting and personal responsibility are key elements of Scrum, for example. I may be stretching here, but in my experience, one of the most valuable benefits of incremental delivery is the responsibility ethos it creates.
<br />
<br />Yes, I know that I wrote an article where <a href="http://www.braithwaite-lee.com/weblog/2004/07/requirements-changes-and-acceptance.html">I described the benefit of incremental deliver in risk management terms</a>. However, explaining things in dry terms "sells" better than explaining the effect on people, especially to management types. (Managers are often the least people-oriented people in the company.)
<br />
<br />Back to incremental development. When a developer has a task, and you explain that they are on the critical path, and you show them a GANTT chart the size of the conference room wall, they're going to shrug their shoulders. Likewise, if you show them a huge baroque architecture and explain their component's place, they're again going to shrug their shoulders.
<br />
<br />The twin problems facing us are that any task in a long, architecturally complex project suffers from a lack of urgency and a lack of importance, because over the remaining time in the project lots of things can change.
<br />
<br />There's so much uncertainty in any project more than a month long that there's absolutely no way to instill a sense of urgency until about four weeks away from a milestone. And likewise there's absolutely no importance attached to any task until people can see that deliverable functions are going to break if the task isn't completed.
<br />
<br />When you have milestones a month or so apart, there's a constant sense of urgency around the dates. Now what about responsibility? Well, if a developer's work is due by the milestone but it's hidden away in some dusty recess of the framework, there's urgency but no importance.
<br />
<br />To instill responsibility, you need urgency AND importance. You add the importance by tying the work as closely as possible to functionality in the finished software. When a developer can see that her work must be done in the next four weeks otherwise some function that stakeholders/users/customers want will break, she's motivated. She can take responsibility.
<br />
<br />Thus, incremental development. When you identify increments of the finished product to be delivered on a monthly basis, you are making urgency and importance plain and visible. And oh yeas, that buys you "frequent reporting."
<br />
<br />Maybe Agile is, at the end of the day, just good management practice.
